Introduction

It is a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.

Features I have added to extend the project:

1. Added the functionality of displaying Hotel & Flight details.
2. Added Save button.
